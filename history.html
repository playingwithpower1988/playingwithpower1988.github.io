			<h1>A brief history of <i>Nintendo Power</i></h1>
			<h3>Creation</h3>
			<p><i>Nintendo Power</i> was initially something called the <i>Nintendo Fun Club News</i>, a free newsletter that had launched in early 1987 that then grew into a full-color magazine with a subscriber base of over one million. In 1988, the Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa decided it was time to launch a full-sized, in house magazine before a competitor could. He wanted to capture the same kind of print media culture that was strong with kids in Japan, who bought magazines like <i>Jump</i> every week and were also buying magazines supporting gameplay at the time. With the founding duo editors of Gail Tilden and Howard Philips working in conjunction with Mr. Arakawa, a plan was born to combine the concepts of the <i>Nintendo Fun Club News</i> and the newly made Nintendo Player's guides to form what came to be <i>Nintendo Power.</i></p>
			
			<h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
			<p>The magazine didn't have a large team behind it; as a matter of fact, it was about six people between Nintendo of America and Work House and Tokuma in Japan that had started out on the magazine.  After a while Gail Tilden was able to get some more staff, but compared to how things would play out today, it's incredible to look back at how such a large magazine began with such few people behind it. Not only was it a small team, but there was an incredible amount of effort was made by them to make sure everything was perfect. Howard Philips, Nintendo of America's Gamemaster, spent hours and hours poring over every little detail to make sure the maps, tips and strategies provided were as accurate as possible.  There were issues at times in the beginning, such as the cultural clash between Gail Tilden, an American woman who was the company's head of marketing and PR, and the Japanese team she worked with, that actually led to the initial design team quitting. In the end, though, the debut issue was released and led to an astonishing success.</p>
				
			<h3>Groundbreaking Popularity</h3>
			<p>Almost immediately after its debut, <i>Nintendo Power</i> became a huge hit with its target audience; by 1989, it broke over 2 million readers. At the end of 1990, it had a subscriber base of over 6 million. There were even exclusive comics just for the magazine, such as the Howard & Nester comic strip that provided a unique and fun way to provide tips and tricks beyond just listing them. And for certain titles, they had segments that would loosely follow the game's story with its own spin on the world. Most notably, for <i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</i>, they got legendary manga creator Shotaro Ishinomori to create a twelve part manga just for <i>Nintendo Power</i>. Shotaro Ishinomori is most famous for his works <i>Kamen Rider</i> and <i>Super Sentai</i> (otherwise known as <i>Power Rangers</i> outside of Japan). The fact that he made a manga just for the magazine speaks volumes about the weight that it held in its prime. While the magazine had reached its peak in the 90's, its immense popularity and status as the de-facto source of information for everything Nintendo let it still stand strong as a magazine as time went on.</p>
				
			<h3>Ending of an Era</h3>
			<p>While it shattered records and carved a name for itself in gaming history, <i>Nintendo Power</i> wasn't going to last forever. As its initial audience aged and digital mediums started to thrive, the magazine's kid friendly image and very "of-its-time" appearance began to backfire on them. After a redesign in 2005, the magazine had a little bit of life breathed back into it, but come 2012, the announcement that <i>Nintendo Power</i> was to be discontinued was made and the final volume was released in December of 2012. In 2017, a podcast version was launched and ran until it was put on hiatus in 2023. While it ended almost a decade and a half ago at the time of writing, the magazine's unparalleled influence in the video game world is still undeniable to this day.</p>
